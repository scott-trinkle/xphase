@article{Gureyev2004,
abstract = {The first Born and Rytov approximations of scattering theory are introduced in their less familiar near-field versions. Two algorithms for phase retrieval based on these approximations are then described. It is shown theoretically and by numerical simulations that, despite the differences in their formulation, the two algorithms deliver fairly similar results when used for optical phase retrieval in the near and intermediate fields. The algorithms are applied to derive explicit solutions to four phase-retrieval problems of practical relevance to quantitative phase-contrast imaging and tomography. An example of successful phase reconstruction by use of the Born-type algorithm with an experimental x-ray image is presented.},
